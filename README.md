# Web Technologies

This subject focused on creating websites using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Assignment

This subject had two assignments.

The [first assignment](Assignment%201/Assignment%201.pdf) was developing a website with **Wordpress**. This website was for tourism promotion of a particular city. It had to include information about the city, pharmacy's, public transports, tourism spots, contacts, etc. The assignment was done in teams of two, chosen by the teacher. My partner was [@leandrofidalgo](https://github.com/leandrofidalgo).  
To run the first assignment simply run the `usbwebserver.exe`. Then open your browser and type in `localhost:8080/wordpress`.

The [second assignment](Assignment%202/Assignment%202.pdf) was to create a replica of an NBA team's website. The objective was to build it using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It was a solo project.  
To run the second assignment simply go to the `HTML` folder, and open the `index.html` file with a browser.
